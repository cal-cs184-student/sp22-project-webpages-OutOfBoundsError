			<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					First, I found the left most and right most coordinates, as well as finding the bottom and top most y coordinates. This is used to defined a region in which we will rasterize triangle.
				</li>
				<li>
					I defined a helper function which performs the line test given a point and 2 other and determine whether the point is inside a triangle.
				</li>
				<li>
					I perform the line test 3 times to cover (P1, P2), (P2, P3), (P3, P1) pairs, and if all 3 results in a positive value, we know that the point is inside the triangle. Otherwise, it is not.
				</li>
				<li>
					My algorithm only checks points that are bounded within the 3 provided points, so it just checks pixels within a box using the values of the 3 provided points.
				</li>

			<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					I added 2 additional for loops to rasterize_triangle which samples the subpixels within each pixel using the step size of 1/sqrt(sampling_rate).
				</li>
				<li>
					I modified the set_framebuffer_target() and set_sample_rate() such that the resize also accounts for sample rate. 
				</li>
				<li>
					I added the same 2 for loop from rasterize_triangle into resolve_to_framebuffer() such that it adds all the values of the subpixels and divide by the sample rate. 
				</li>
				<li>
					My algorithm only checks points that are bounded within the 3 provided points, so it just checks pixels within a box using the values of the 3 provided points.

			<h2>Task 3: Transform</h2>

				<li>
					I wanted the cubeman to wave his right hand.

			<h2>Task 4: Barycentric Coordinates</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Barycentric coordinates is a coordinate system that determines how similar a particular point is with the 3 vertices that determines the triangle. For example,
					if a point is directly on one of the vertices, then we know that it is exactly the color defined at that corner. However, if a point is in the center of the triangle, 
					then it will be a mix of all three vertex color.
